# DomiPizza App
- It is a Django based application in which users after login are able to browse the restaurantâ€™s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders.
- In backend restaurant owners can add and update menu items, view orders that have been placed, and change the status of the order.
- Bootstrap4 is also included in order to make it more appealing. Program automatically creates superuser account at first start.

###### Additional Feature- 
I have added a feature of allowing the site administrator to mark orders as complete and as soon as the site administrator changes the status of the order the user can see it updated in their my orders tab.
